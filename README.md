# Programming Fundamentals using Python Part-1

- ### Importance of programming

In this digital era, the knowledge of programming is essential to bring innovation and change. To create value with your own ideas you need know coding.   Programming has become basic literacy for the 21st century.

- ### Understanding programming by considering scenarios at airport

In the airport there are many flights landing and taking off. Unlike road traffic, the flights don’t have direct information of other flights around them. The Air Traffic Control (ATC) at the ground gives instructions to each flight on what it should do.

Similarly, instructions are provided to computer to accomplish specific tasks. Such instructions are known as program and the act of creating a program is known as programming.

- ### Algorithm, pseudo-code and flowchart

Algorithm should be represented from the mental thoughts into a form which others can understand. There are primarily two ways of representing an algorithm:

    Flow chart: Diagrammatic way of representing the algorithm.
    Pseudo-code: Representing the algorithm between a program and normal English.

For example, here is a pseudo-code and a flowchart.

- ### 5 minute Quiz - Iteration Constructs

- ### Python- data-types, variables and its dimensions


  Python programming language supports the following datatypes:

  | Category | Python |
  |----|----|
  | Numeric | int, long, complex |
  | Numeric with decimal point | float |
  | Alphanumeric | string |
  | Boolean | boolean |

  A variable is a name that is assigned to a value. It is done so that we can refer to that value at some later point in the program. We have seen that a variable will have a name, value, type and it will occupy memory. Apart from these, it has two more dimensions – scope and lifetime. Thus we can say that any variable will have the following six dimensions.
